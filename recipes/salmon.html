            <h4>How to make Salmon Step-by-Step</h4>
            <li>Preheat a grill to medium-high heat
                (375 to 450 degrees).</li>
            <li>Brine the salmon (or go to Marinated
                 Salmon to marinade instead): While the
                  grill preheats, in a shallow dish mix 
                  together 4 cups room temperature water 
                  and 3 tablespoons kosher salt. Place the 
                  salmon in the water and wait for 15 
                  minutes (this should be about the time 
                  it takes to preheat).</li>
            <li>Pat the salmon dry with a clean towel.
                 Rub it generously with oil and 
                 sprinkle it with the kosher salt 
                 and seasoning blend (or simply 
                 salt and pepper).</li>
            <li>Grill the salmon skin side up for 3 to
                 5 minutes (where the flames arenâ€™t 
                 directly touching the fish), until 
                 grill marks appear and it releases from
                the grates. Flip and cook another 2 to
                5 minutes, depending on the thickness
                 of the salmon, until flaky and just
                pink at the thickest portion and the 
                internal temperature is 125 to 130
                degrees. (Salmon varies in thickness,
                so the cook time is different based
                on each piece of fish.) Allow to
                rest for a few minutes, 
                then serve.</li>
