            <h4>How to make Oxtail Step-by-Step</h4>
            <li> Rinse oxtails with water and vinegar
                and pat dry. Cover oxtails with brown sugar,
                soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt,
                garlic powder, black pepper, all-spice,
                and browning and rub into oxtails.</li>
            <li>Set Pressure Cooker on High Saut√© and once 
                hot, add vegetable oil. Next, add your larger
                 oxtail pieces to the pot, flat side down
                  about ¬º inch apart, and brown on each side.</li>
            <li>Remove oxtail after browning and place in bowl.</li>
            <li>Deglaze your pressure cooker by adding about 2
                 Tbsp of beef broth to the insert. Take a wooden
                  spoon and deglaze your pot by removing the 
                  brown bits at the bottom. Then add your yellow 
                  onions, green onions, carrots, garlic, and
                   scotch bonnet pepper. Stir and saut√© for 
                   about 5 minutes or until the onions have 
                   softened.</li>
            <li>Add dried thyme, oxtails, remaining beef broth, 
                and ketchup to the pressure cooker insert.</li>
            <li>Press ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù on your Instant Pot.
                 Cover and cook on high pressure for
                45 minutes. Once timer is done, allow
                 pressure cooker to naturally release.</li>
            <li>Once all pressure has released, open
                 lid and remove oxtails and vegetables,
                  leaving liquid behind. Turn Pressure 
                  Cooker on saut√©. Once liquid begins 
                  to simmer, create a corn starch slurry
                 by combining corn starch and water to 
                  a separate bowl. Stir into simmering
                 liquid. Add drained butter beans
                 into pressure cooker and allow to simmer
                  for about 5 minutes, until liquid is 
                  slightly thickened and butterbeans are 
                  warmed.</li>
            <li>Add oxtails and vegetables back to
                 the pressure cooker. Serve and enjoy üôÇ
            </li>
